		<h1>
		Lab 6: Arrays and Objects
		</h1>
		<p>
			Working with my partner we experimented with JavaScript Arrays and Objects.
		</p>
		<br></br>
		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p>
			My partner and I didn't face too many challenges while performing lab6. The directions where
			pretty clear and straight forward.
		</p>
		<br></br>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p>
			The only problem that came up while doing the lab was trying to display the correct Javascript file
			onto our index.html file. But the error was coming from a simple syntax error in the lab.js file.
		</p>
		<br></br>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p>
			Here are the results from our lab6 Javascript File and Index.html.
