				I would like to consider myself a very extroverted guy. I've been active in social orgs
	      at school such as Japanese Student Association and Korean American Student Association.
	      In my free time I normally would hangout with friends but ever since quarentine started I've
	      been playing a lot of videogames in my free time. The main game I've been running with my
	      friends is Valorant which is a competitive shooter. I also have a dog named buddy. Hes
	      a dachshund and I love him a lot. In the future I would like to have some sort of job in
	      gaming industry. As of right now any role would be a super fun experience for me but if I
	      had to choose I would proably aim for producer or something with level design. I also enjoy
				listening and finding new music. I make it a goal of mine to listen through the whole New Music
				Friday playlist on spotify that updates every Friday! Even though a majority of the songs aren't
				that good some of them are hype as hell. Another thing I like to do in my free time is watch anime!
				Currently I'm watching One Piece.
