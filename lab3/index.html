			<h1> Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
			<p>
				The goal of this lab is to learn how to create a local file structure
				on my computer and add index.html files to multiple folders.
			</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>
				I didn't have too much of a challenge for this lab. The only challenge I came across
				was just the issue of making sure I didn't have any syntax errors. For the most part
				everything was pretty smooth and everything linked together perfectly the first time
				I tried it.
			</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				While you are looking at my index.html file that I created. I shall include a screenshot
				of the file structure I made.
